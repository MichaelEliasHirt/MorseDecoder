## 10/23/2025 - Software Grind  

I started up my python brain again and wrote the code in python. I am using micropython to control the Esp32. I mounted everything on a breadboard and it seems to work, the input, the screen, the sound.. all good!![DSC01462.JPG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDc4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f436a266fd37521dc976ed5f57a2e6b381113f01/DSC01462.JPG)!
